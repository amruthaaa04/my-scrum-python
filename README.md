\## 🚀 Project Description



This is a simple Flask-based API application.  

The purpose is to show how code can be managed, tested, and deployed using

Configuration Management principles.



The repository follows \*\*Scrum\*\* practices.  

Each sprint has its own branch (e.g., `sprint/1`), and all work is committed

and pushed through GitHub with continuous integration enabled.
